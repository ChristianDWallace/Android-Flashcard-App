# Android Flashcard App
 An app made during my final semester of college. The code is not representative of my current skill level, but i'm throwing it up here to keep track of my projects

It's a simple android application that allows you to make decks of flashcards, and then take a quiz that randomizes the cards and keeps track of your final score.
